# add-light-and-dark-toggle-in-js
This project demonstrates how to implement a dark and light mode toggle feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By clicking on a button, users can switch between dark and light themes, with the preference stored in local storage so that the mode persists across sessions.
